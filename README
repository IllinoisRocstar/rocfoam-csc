Ensure you have the latest version of GCC on your machine.
OpenFOAM-7 is needed for this application. Download and compile OpenFOAM-7 prior to copiling rocFoam.
Also you need to install IMPACT library on your machine and set the variable IMPACT_INSTALL_PATH to the installation folder path.

>> Defenition varibales:
[1] $ROCFOAM_SOURCE = source directory of rocFoam
[2] $FOAM = source directory of OpenFOAM
[3] $ROCFOAM_INSTALL = instalation directory of rocFoam
[4] $IMPACT_INSTALL_PATH = IMPACT installation directory


>> Compilation of rocFoam: 
[1] Transfer the files in the folder "$ROCFOAM_SOURCE/src/Pstream/mpi/" to the folder "$FOAM/src/Pstream/mpi/"
[2] Transfer the files in the folder "$ROCFOAM_SOURCE/src/dynamicFvMesh/dynamicFvMesh/" to the folder "$FOAM/src/dynamicFvMesh/dynamicFvMesh/"
[3] Remake OpenFOAM by executing "./Allwmake" in "$FOAM" foalder
[4] Go to the source folder of rocFoam
[5] Type "mkdir build" followed by "cd build"
[6] Set the installation path for by assigning it to the variable "ROCFOAM_INSTALL"
[7] Execute the following command line for cmake:

cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$ROCFOAM_INSTALL -DIMPACT_HDR=$IMPACT_INSTALL_PATH/include/impact -DIMPACT_LIB=$IMPACT_INSTALL_PATH/lib/libSITCOM.so ..

7) Execute "make install" for serial compilation, or "make install -jX" (X being number of processors) for paralle compilation.


>> To run
1) There are two standalone dirvers for rhoCentralFoan and rhoPimpleFoam, respectively called rocRhoCentral and rocRhoPimple. They can be used in serial and parallel modes exactly as openFoam solvers, i.e.
    a) Serial:
          <application>

    b) Parallel:
          mpirun -np <nproc> <application> -parallel

    <application> needs to be replaced with rocRhoCentral or rocRhoPimple.


2) rocFoam is a driver for both rocRhoCentral and rocRhoPimple solvers. To initiate any of these solvers, the following commands need to be executed in a terminal:
    a) Serial:
          rocFoam -<application>

    b) Parallel:
          mpirun -np <nproc> rocFoam -parallel -<pplication>
