3) Go to the source folder of rocFoam
4) Type "mkdir build" followed by "cd build"
5) Set the installation path for by assigning it to the variable "ROCFOAM_INSTALL"
6) Execute the following command line for cmake:

cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$ROCFOAM_INSTALL -DIMPACT_HDR=$IMPACT_INSTALL_PATH/include/impact -DIMPACT_LIB=$IMPACT_INSTALL_PATH/lib/libSITCOM.so -DMPI_C_COMPILER=/usr/bin/mpicc -DMPI_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/bin/mpicxx -DMPI_Fortran_COMPILER=/usr/bin/mpif90 -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=mpicc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=mpicxx -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=mpif90 ..

7) Execute "make" followed by make install
