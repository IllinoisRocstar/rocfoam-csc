Ensure you have the latest version of GCC on your machine.
* OpenFOAMv2006 is needed for this application. Download it from www.OpenFOAM.com and compile it prior to copiling rocFoam.
* IMPACT is needed for this application. Download and compile it on your machine.
* Boost library is needed. Make sure you have this library on you machine.
* Make sure that all packages are compiled with the same compiler. Also make sure that the mpi cpmpiler is used for compiling the packages.

>> Defenition varibales:
[1] $FOAM_PATH = source directory of OpenFOAM
[2] $ROCFOAM_INSTALL_PATH = instalation directory of rocFoam
[3] $IMPACT_INSTALL_PATH = IMPACT installation directory

>> Compilation of rocFoam:
[1] Remake OpenFOAM by executing "./Allwmake" in "$FOAM" foalder
[2] Go to the source folder of rocFoam
[3] Type "mkdir build" followed by "cd build"
[4] Set the installation path, by assigning it to the variable "ROCFOAM_INSTALL_PATH"
[5] Execute the following command line for cmake:

cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$ROCFOAM_INSTALL_PATH -DCMAKE_IMPACT_DIR=$IMPACT_INSTALL_PATH -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=mpicxx ..

[7] Execute "make install" for serial compilation, or "make install -jX" (X being number of processors) for paralle compilation.


>> To run
[1] There are two standalone dirvers called rocRhoCentral (density-based solver) and rocRhoPimple (pressure-based solver). They can be used in serial and parallel modes to preprocess a simulation case.
    (a) Serial:
          <application> -preprocess

    (b) Parallel:
          mpirun -np <nproc> <application> -parallel -prerocess

    <application> needs to be replaced with rocRhoCentral or rocRhoPimple.


[2] To test if the pre-precessor has benn successfully executed, one could run the commands mentioned above, but replace "-preprocess" with "-production", that is:
    (a) Serial:
          <application> -production

    (b) Parallel:
          mpirun -np <nproc> <application> -parallel -production

    <application> needs to be replaced with rocRhoCentral or rocRhoPimple.
