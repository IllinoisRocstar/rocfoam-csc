Ensure you have the latest version of GCC on your machine.
* OpenFOAM-7 is needed for this application. Download and compile OpenFOAM-7 prior to copiling rocFoam.
* IMPACT is needed for this application. Download and compile it on your machine.
* Boost library is needed. Make sure you have this library on you machine.
* Make sure that all packages are compiled with the same compiler. Also make sure that the mpi cpmpiler is used for compiling the packages.

>> Defenition varibales:
[1] $ROCFOAM_SOURCE_PATH = source directory of rocFoam
[2] $FOAM_PATH = source directory of OpenFOAM
[3] $ROCFOAM_INSTALL_PATH = instalation directory of rocFoam
[4] $IMPACT_INSTALL_PATH = IMPACT installation directory
[5] $BOOST_INC_PATH = address to the boost header files directory   #/usr/include/boost
[6] $BOOST_LIB_PATH = address to the boost library files directory  #/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/



>> Compilation of rocFoam:
[1] Transfer the files in the folder "$ROCFOAM_SOURCE_PATH/src/Pstream/mpi/" to the folder "$FOAM_PATH/src/Pstream/mpi/"
[2] Remake OpenFOAM by executing "./Allwmake" in "$FOAM" foalder
[3] Go to the source folder of rocFoam
[4] Type "mkdir build" followed by "cd build"
[5] Set the installation path, by assigning it to the variable "ROCFOAM_INSTALL_PATH"
[6] Execute the following command line for cmake:

cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$ROCFOAM_INSTALL_PATH -DCMAKE_IMPACT_DIR=$IMPACT_INSTALL_PATH -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=mpicxx ..

[7] Execute "make install" for serial compilation, or "make install -jX" (X being number of processors) for paralle compilation.


>> To run
[1] There are two standalone dirvers for rhoCentralFoan and rhoPimpleFoam, respectively called rocRhoCentral and rocRhoPimple. They can be used in serial and parallel modes exactly as openFoam solvers, i.e.
    (a) Serial:
          <application>

    (b) Parallel:
          mpirun -np <nproc> <application> -parallel

    <application> needs to be replaced with rocRhoCentral or rocRhoPimple.


[2] rocFoam is a driver for both rocRhoCentral and rocRhoPimple solvers. To initiate any of these solvers, the following commands need to be executed in a terminal:
    (a) Serial:
          rocFoam -<application>

    (b) Parallel:
          mpirun -np <nproc> rocFoam -parallel -<pplication>
