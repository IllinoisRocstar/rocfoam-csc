Ensure you have the latest version of GCC on your machine.
OpenFOAM-7 is needed for this application. Download and compile OpenFOAM-7 prior to copiling rocFoam.
Also you need to install IMPACT library on your machine and set the variable IMPACT_INSTALL_PATH to the installation folder path.

>> To compile rocFoam code:
1) Replace the file "UPstream.C" in folder "replaceable" with that of "$FOAM/src/Pstream/mpi/UPstream.C"
2) Remake OpenFOAM by executing "./Allwmake" in "$FOAM" foalder
3) Go to the source folder of rocFoam
4) Type "mkdir build" followed by "cd build"
5) Set the installation path for by assigning it to the variable "ROCFOAM_INSTALL"
6) Execute the following command line for cmake:

cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$ROCFOAM_INSTALL -DIMPACT_HDR=$IMPACT_INSTALL_PATH/include/impact -DIMPACT_LIB=$IMPACT_INSTALL_PATH/lib/libSITCOM.so -DMPI_C_COMPILER=/usr/bin/mpicc -DMPI_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/bin/mpicxx -DMPI_Fortran_COMPILER=/usr/bin/mpif90 -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=mpicc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=mpicxx -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=mpif90 ..

7) Execute "make" followed by make install


>> To run
1) There are two standalone dirvers for rhoCentralFoan and rhoPimpleFoam, respectively called rocRhoCentral and rocRhoPimple. They can be used in serial and parallel modes exactly as openFoam solvers. 
2) rocFoam is a driver which includes both rocRhoCentral and rocRhoPimple solvers. To initiate any of these solvers, the following commands need to be executed in a terminal:

a) Serial:
      rocFoam -<application>

b) Parallel:
      mpirun -np <nproc> rocFoam -parallel -<pplication>

<application> need to be replace with rocRhoCentral or rocRhoPimple.
